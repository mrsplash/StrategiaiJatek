# StrategiaiJatek

This is the project i made for a university class introduced us into the Java world.

The code is bad and solutions are terrible, but for the first time it is alright.

As far is I remember it is using an external lib, which wasnt allowed. Still I got good grades and it was OK.

This is only for archival purposes.
